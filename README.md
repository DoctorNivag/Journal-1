# Journal-1
-My First Journal- -Used For Notes-
-- Repository (Repo)
   -- A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

-- Git
   -- "git" can mean anything, depending on your mood.
- random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
- stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
- "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
- "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks This is a stupid (but extremely fast) directory content manager.

It doesn't do a whole lot, but what it _does_ do is track directory contents efficiently.

-- Github
   -- GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers. Microsoft, the biggest single contributor to GitHub, initiated an acquisition of GitHub for $7.5 billion in June 2018. GitHub, which is delivered through a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model, was started in 2008 and was founded on Git, an open-source code management system created by Linus Torvalds to make software builds faster.

-- CLI (Command-line interface)
   -- A command-line interface processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor.

-- Terminal
   -- The terminal is the actual interface to the console that you can type and execute text-based commands. You can enter commands after the command prompt. Keep in mind that you cannot access source code through a terminal. The terminal is used to execute commands that allow you to do a certain task.

-- GUI (Graphical User Interface)
   -- a visual way of interacting with a computer using items such as windows, icons, and menus, used by most modern operating systems.

-- IDE
   -- An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, enables programmers to consolidate the different aspects of writing a computer program. IDEs increase programmer productivity by combining common activities of writing software into a single application: editing source code, building executables, and debugging.

-- VS Code
   -- Visual Studio Code is an integrated development environment made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

-- Abstraction
   -- Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that "shows" only essential attributes and "hides" unnecessary information. ... Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only relevant details of the object to the user. It helps in reducing programming complexity and efforts.
